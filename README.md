# Comparisons-of-global-grids-with-spherical-harmonics
This repository contains a working example showing how two global grids can be compared. The comparisons include simple Euclidean statistics (i.e. for point to point comparisons), and comparisons in the spherical harmonic domain including spectral power and degree (scale) dependent correlation.
